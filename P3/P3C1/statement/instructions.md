In the `main.py` file you can see that it is full of classes, functions, and other code, all of which are jumbled together into one file.

Split the program into **modules** and **packages**, adding `__init__.py` files and import statements where needed. Make sure that the program can be run by running a main.py in the projectâ€™s root directory.
