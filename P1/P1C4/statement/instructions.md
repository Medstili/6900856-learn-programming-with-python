# Instructions

In your own development environment, write three classes, one for each of the classes you identified and planned in the last chapter’s exercise.

You won’t know how to implement some of the methods yet, and that’s OK; just leave the method body empty. In Python, you can do this with the keyword “pass,” like this:

```
def method_stub(self, length):
   pass
```

## Reminder : 

The three classes that you need to create : 

1. I have a toolbox. That toolbox can contain some tools, and I can add or remove tools from the toolbox.
2. My toolbox can contain hammers. Hammers come in various colors and can be used to hammer in and remove nails. I can also change the color of the hammer by painting it.
3. My toolbox can contain screwdrivers. They come in sizes (measured in millimeters) and can be used to tighten or loosen a screw.
