Below will be a few lines describing a situation. For each situation, identify a class and draw a simple diagram like the one above. Then identify any variables it should have based on the description, followed by any methods. Don’t add any attributes that aren’t mentioned in the description.

* I have a toolbox. That toolbox can contain some tools, and I can add or remove tools from the toolbox.
* My toolbox can contain hammers. Hammers come in various colors and can be used to hammer in and remove nails. I can also change the color of the hammer by painting it.
* My toolbox can contain screwdrivers. They come in sizes (measured in millimeters) and can be used to tighten or loosen a screw.
