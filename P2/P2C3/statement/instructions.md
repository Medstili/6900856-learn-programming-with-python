# Instructions  

In this exercise, you’ll be adding overriding to the code used in the last chapter.

Firstly, though, can you think of any classes that should be abstract in your hierarchy? If so, turn them into abstract classes.

Override the display method of `FilePost` (or your equivalent) to display its corresponding `File` at the bottom of the post. Then, override the `display` method of your `Image` class to print the image’s name and alt text.
